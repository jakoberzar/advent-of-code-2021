## Script for starting a new day

```bash
./new_day.sh <day_name>
```

## Python

### Running code

```bash
python python/day<day_name>.py <filename>
```

where `<filename>` is usually `simple` or `full`.

### Testing code

...TODO? :)

## Chocolate

```bash
<choco compiler> choco/day<day_name>.choco
```

## Other language candidates

- Ruby or Crystal too see what Ruby feels like?
- Zig or Go to learn another systems language?
- Java, Kotlin, C++ to polish skills?
